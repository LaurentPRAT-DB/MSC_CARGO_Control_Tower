## The Business Problem

Air cargo operations face a compounding problem during disruptions: **a single delayed flight can put millions in revenue at risk, damage VIP customer relationships, and trigger SLA penalties** — all within hours.

Traditional operations teams monitor flights in isolation. They see delays, but lack the commercial context to prioritize: Which delayed flight carries $520K of pharmaceutical cargo for a Platinum customer whose sentiment score is already dropping? Which protected flight is 3 hours from breaching its contractual SLA?

Without business-impact ranking, teams treat all disruptions equally — wasting time on low-value recoveries while high-value cargo and key accounts go unprotected.

## The Solution

The Control Tower bridges operational and commercial data to enable **business-impact-driven prioritization**:

| Capability | What It Does | Business Outcome |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Revenue-at-Risk Scoring | Ranks delays by dollar impact, not just duration | Ops teams focus on the highest-value disruptions first |
| VIP Crisis Detection | Auto-surfaces Platinum/VIP cargo on delayed flights | Account managers get alerted before customers escalate |
| SLA Compliance Tracker | Monitors protected flights against contractual deadlines | Penalty costs are mitigated before breach occurs |
| AI Operations Advisor | Generates specific re-routing and escalation plans per crisis | Reduces decision time from hours to minutes |
| Natural Language Queries | Ask questions in plain English, get instant data answers | No SQL expertise required for ad-hoc investigation |

## Technical Architecture

The entire stack runs on Databricks — no external services, no separate cloud infrastructure, no additional authentication systems.

### Component Integration

| Component | Role | Integration Pattern |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| **Databricks Apps** | Hosts the Streamlit application with managed compute and automatic OAuth | App calls all other services via the Databricks SDK `WorkspaceClient` |
| **Unity Catalog** | Governed data layer — tables, views, volumes, lineage, and access control | App queries UC tables via SQL Warehouse; Genie reads UC metadata for NL understanding |
| **Serverless SQL Warehouse** | Executes all SQL queries with zero infrastructure management | App sends SQL via the Statement Execution API (`/api/2.0/sql/statements`) |
| **Genie Space** | Natural language to SQL interface with domain-specific configuration | App calls the Genie Conversation API; space is configured with 7 tables, join hints, and benchmarks |
| **Model Serving** | Hosts the LLM for AI-powered recommendations and crisis response | App sends prompts via the Serving Endpoint API (`/serving-endpoints/{name}/invocations`) |

---

## Governance & Security

The application follows Databricks governance best practices end-to-end:

**Data Governance (Unity Catalog)**
- All data lives in UC-managed tables with full lineage tracking
- Column-level access control available for sensitive fields
- Every query is audited with the Service Principal identity as actor
- Views encapsulate business logic — the app never writes raw SQL joins for aggregations

**Application Security**
- Authentication is OAuth M2M — no tokens or passwords stored anywhere
- The Service Principal has least-privilege grants: `SELECT` only on the 7 required tables/views
- All configuration is via environment variables (app.yaml) — zero secrets in code
- Resource declarations in app.yaml auto-provision permissions for the SQL Warehouse and Serving Endpoint

**Audit Trail**
- Every SQL query, Genie conversation, and LLM invocation is logged with the SP identity
- Unity Catalog lineage tracks data from source volumes through tables and views to query results
- Databricks Apps logs capture application-level events (errors, deployments, restarts)

## AI Strategy: Cloud-Agnostic LLM Access

The Control Tower uses **Claude Sonnet 4** for AI-powered operations advisory and crisis response — served through Databricks Model Serving, not called directly from an external API.

**Why this matters:**

| Principle | How Databricks Delivers It |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Cloud Independence** | Databricks runs on AWS, Azure, and GCP. The same app deploys to any cloud without changing a single line of code. No direct cloud-provider AI API dependencies. |
| **Best-of-Breed Model Access** | Databricks Model Serving provides access to models from Anthropic (Claude), Meta (Llama), Google, Mistral, and others — switch models by changing one environment variable. |
| **Price / Performance Optimization** | Route between model providers based on cost, latency, and quality. Use Claude for complex reasoning, Llama for high-throughput summaries — all through the same API. |
| **Unified Governance** | LLM calls go through the same Service Principal, are logged in the same audit system, and respect the same access controls as data queries. No shadow AI. |
| **No Vendor Lock-In** | The app calls `/serving-endpoints/{name}/invocations` — a Databricks API. Swapping from Claude to GPT-4 or Llama requires zero code changes, just a new endpoint name. |

```
App  →  Databricks Model Serving  →  Anthropic (Claude)
                                  →  Meta (Llama)
                                  →  Google (Gemini)
                                  →  Mistral
                                  →  Custom fine-tuned models
```

The LLM is used for two capabilities:
1. **Operations Advisor** (Flight Ops page) — analyzes all delayed flights and their shipments, generates a structured 5-point advisory with re-routing options, customer escalation priorities, and SLA protection steps
2. **Crisis Response** (Priority page) — generates immediate action plans for the highest-impact VIP crisis scenario
